# Roadmap: SoundHash to v1.0 (Milestones, Priorities, Full Issue Index)

This is the body template used to create the master roadmap issue programmatically.

- **Live Roadmap**: [Issue #34](https://github.com/subculture-collective/soundhash/issues/34)
- **Project Board**: [@onnwee's soundhash](https://github.com/users/onnwee/projects)
- **Milestones**: M0â€“M4 (see [milestones page](https://github.com/subculture-collective/soundhash/milestones))
- **Labels**: `priority:P0/P1/P2`, `type:*`, `area:*` (see `.github/labels.md`)

The master issue will link to sub-issues after creation. All issues should be added to the project board for visual tracking and progress updates.
