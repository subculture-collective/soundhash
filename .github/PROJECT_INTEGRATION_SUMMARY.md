# Project Board Integration - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate the "@onnwee's soundhash" GitHub Project board with the repository.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Files

#### `.github/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md` (NEW)

Complete guide for setting up and managing the GitHub Project board, including:

- Instructions for accessing and configuring the project
- Methods for connecting all 34 issues to the project (manual, bulk, API)
- Recommended project views (Kanban, By Milestone, By Priority, By Area)
- Automation rules configuration
- Workflow guidance for planning, assignment, tracking, review, and reporting
- Reference to label taxonomy and milestones

#### `ROADMAP.md` (UPDATED)

Enhanced with comprehensive links to:

- Master roadmap issue (#34)
- GitHub Project board (@onnwee's soundhash)
- All issues page
- Milestones page

#### `.github/ROADMAP_MASTER_ISSUE_BODY.md` (UPDATED)

Template file updated with:

- Links to live roadmap (Issue #34)
- Project board link
- Reference to milestones and label taxonomy
- Note about adding issues to the project board

#### `README.md` (UPDATED)

Added new "Project Status" section at the top with quick links to:

- Roadmap (Issue #34)
- Project Board (@onnwee's soundhash)
- Milestones

### 2. Automation Workflows

#### `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml` (NEW)

GitHub Actions workflow providing:

- Automatic addition of new issues and PRs to the project board
- Comprehensive documentation for setup and configuration

**Note**: Status updates (moving items between columns) are best handled by GitHub's built-in project workflows for simplicity and reliability.

### 3. Helper Scripts

#### `scripts/add_issues_to_project.py` (EXISTING)

Python script providing:

- Instructions for manual project board setup
- gh CLI commands for bulk-adding all 34 issues
- Project automation configuration commands
- Environment variable setup guidance

## Current State

### Issues

- **Total**: 34 issues created (#1-#34)
- **Master Issue**: #34 "Roadmap (Master): Foundations → Matching → Ops"
- **Milestones**: 4 milestones created (M0, M1, M2, M3)
- **Labels**: Full taxonomy applied with priority, type, and area labels

### Project Board

- **Name**: @onnwee's soundhash
- **Status**: Created by user
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow ready (requires setup)
- **Documentation**: Complete

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Configure Automation (Required)

**Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**

1. **Create Personal Access Token**
   - Go to Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
   - Create fine-grained token with `Projects` and `Issues` permissions
   - Copy the token

2. **Add Token to Repository**
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Add secret named `PROJECT_TOKEN` with your token value

3. **Update Project URL**
   - Find your project number at <https://github.com/users/onnwee/projects>
   - Edit `.github/workflows/project-automation.yml`
   - Update `project-url` with correct project number

4. **Test the Workflow**
   - Create a test issue
   - Verify it appears on the project board automatically

**Option B: Built-in GitHub Project Automation (Alternative)**

Use this instead of GitHub Actions if you prefer an all-in-one solution:

1. Open your project at <https://github.com/users/onnwee/projects>
2. Click "..." menu → "Workflows"
3. Enable: "Auto-add to project", "Item closed", "Pull request merged"

**Recommended Approach**: Use GitHub Actions (Option A) for adding items + Built-in workflows for status updates.

### 2. Navigate to Project Board
   - Go to <https://github.com/users/onnwee/projects>
   - Open the "@onnwee's soundhash" project

### 3. Add All Existing Issues
   - Use the project's "+" button
   - Select "Add items from repository"
   - Choose subculture-collective/soundhash
   - Select all 34 issues or use bulk-add script

### 4. Configure Views (see `.github/PROJECT_BOARD_SETUP.md`)
   - Create "Kanban Board" view (Todo, In Progress, In Review, Done)
   - Create "By Milestone" view (group by milestone M0-M3)
   - Create "By Priority" view (group by P0, P1, P2)
   - Create "By Area" view (group by area labels)

### 5. Enable Status Update Workflows (Recommended)
   - Go to project → "..." menu → "Workflows"
   - Enable "Item closed" and "Pull request merged" workflows
   - This handles automatic status updates when items change state

### 6. Verify Automation is Working
   - Create a new test issue
   - Confirm it appears on the project board automatically
   - Close the issue and verify it moves to "Done" (if built-in workflow enabled)
