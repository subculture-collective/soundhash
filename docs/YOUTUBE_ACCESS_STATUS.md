# YouTube Access Status & Solutions

## Current Issue

YouTube has implemented aggressive bot detection that blocks yt-dlp access with "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" errors, even with:

- Simple subprocess calls (avoiding Python API)
- Browser cookie attempts
- Various user agent strategies
- Minimal request patterns

## Working Components ✅

- Database schema and connectivity
- Audio fingerprinting system (librosa-based)
- Video processing pipeline (except YouTube download)
- CLI interface with dry-run mode
- Job queuing and processing system
- FFmpeg audio conversion and segmentation

## Blocked Components ❌

- YouTube video/audio downloading via yt-dlp
- Channel video listing
- Video metadata extraction

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: YouTube Data API (Recommended)

Switch to official YouTube Data API v3 for metadata and use alternative audio sources:

```python
# Example API call for channel videos
youtube = build('youtube', 'v3', developerKey=API_KEY)
request = youtube.search().list(
    part='snippet',
    channelId=channel_id,
    type='video',
    maxResults=50
)
```

**Pros:**

- Official API, no bot detection
- Reliable metadata access
- Rate limits but predictable

**Cons:**

- Requires API key and quota management
- Cannot download audio directly (need alternative sources)

### Option 2: Manual Cookie Export

Export browser cookies manually and use with yt-dlp:

```bash
# Export cookies from browser session
yt-dlp --cookies cookies.txt --extract-audio URL
```

**Pros:**

- Can bypass bot detection temporarily
- Works with current pipeline

**Cons:**

- Manual process
- Cookies expire and need refresh
- Not suitable for automated systems

### Option 3: Alternative Audio Sources

Focus on other platforms or audio sources:

- SoundCloud API
- Podcast RSS feeds
- User-uploaded audio files
- Audio streaming services with APIs

### Option 4: Distributed/Proxy Approach

Use rotating proxies and distributed requests:

- Multiple IP addresses
- Request throttling
- Browser automation (Selenium)

## Current System Status

The ingestion system is **90% complete** with only YouTube access blocked:

- ✅ Complete database schema
- ✅ Audio fingerprinting system
- ✅ Job processing pipeline
- ✅ CLI tools and dry-run mode
- ✅ Docker setup
- ❌ YouTube video access (blocked)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement YouTube Data API v3 for metadata
2. **Short-term**: Add manual cookie support for audio download
3. **Long-term**: Expand to alternative audio sources

## Test Commands

Test the working components:

```bash
# Test database and system
python scripts/test_system.py

# Test with manual audio files
python -c "from src.core.audio_fingerprinting import AudioFingerprinter; af = AudioFingerprinter(); print('Fingerprinter ready')"
```
