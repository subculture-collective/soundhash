# Roadmap

Please refer to the following resources for the live plan:

- **Master Roadmap Issue**: [#34 - Roadmap (Master): Foundations → Matching → Ops](https://github.com/subculture-collective/soundhash/issues/34)
- **GitHub Project Board**: [@onnwee's soundhash](https://github.com/users/onnwee/projects) - Kanban view with milestones
- **All Issues**: [Issues page](https://github.com/subculture-collective/soundhash/issues)
- **Milestones**: [Milestones page](https://github.com/subculture-collective/soundhash/milestones)

This file intentionally stays brief; all task tracking and status live in Issues, Milestones, and the Project Board.
